# TheExpanseRPG_Resources
This repo will contain a couple of translated or self-written scenarios for The Expanse RPG, as well as a lot of self-made compilations of rules.

## Latest addition
A larger scenario (Derelict Mind) has been uploaded here. Currently only in Swedish, might get around to translating it in the future.
I've also uploaded a couple of 3D models of a space station in that scenario to google drive, which can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GI-_C2f1aoWhNPmIrZPCX0XsAMSKI3sN" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Coming up
Currently working on a another scenario (with Lovecraft vibes!) that probably will make its way here as well, eventually.

## Acknowledgements
This is a fan-made repository, with no affiliations with the official The Expanse RPG.

### On compilation contents:
Unless specifically specified, all compilations consist of information taken from the official The Expanse RPG guides, and arranged in an easy-to-print way, to make the roleplaying a bit easier. This means that the contents of the compilations are not everything needed for playing this roleplaying game, and that you should still have to buy the actual The Expanse RPG books to use them. My intention is not to play pirate, but to make things easier for those who already have bought the game.
